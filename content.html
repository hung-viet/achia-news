<p class="ps-4 py-2 fw-normal">âœ… The new client for Windows is uploaded in here, I will build a Linux version later today. <a tabindex="0" role="link" href="https://github.com/achia-co/OG-plot/releases/download/v1.2.2/ChiaSetup-1.2.231.exe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/achia-co/OG-plot/releases/download/v1.2.2/ChiaSetup-1.2.231.exe</a></p>
<p class="ps-4 py-2 fw-normal">âœ… DELETE the "config.yaml" in your CONFIG folder OR RENAME if you want to backup. After the 1st run, close the CHIA GUI and change 'achia_payout_address: None' in the new config.yaml file to your wallet address to receive rewards at that wallet. For example:
    achia_payout_address: xch123456789xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p class="ps-4 py-2 fw-normal">âœ… We will only farm 1.75 XCH and share that reward, 0.25 XCH will be farmed by the winner to be consistent with Official Protocol. (That's why you'll need to delete the config.yaml in the step above to get your correct wallet and other settings)</p>
